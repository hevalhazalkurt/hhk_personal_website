    <div class="single-page__content">
      <p>As a filmmaker, I have 15 years of experience in film and digital marketing. In these years, I developed and managed many commercial strategies for many big brands, film, and other production from the script to the editing stage. I have attended film festivals with my independent short films and got awards. I have taken part in teams of big TV networks and blockbuster films. I have organized workshops, masterclasses, events, and made podcasts for enthusiasts of filmmaking.</p> <br>

      <p>As a developer, I have founded Turkey's largest filmmaker platform for 13 years, and I have managed for both the technical side and content. In these years, I have gained some technical skills such as Wordpress, HTML, CSS, Python, Django; and some soft skills such as communication, presentation, organization, PR, teaching, targeting, managing growth. However, after a while, knowing just what I needed wasn't enough, and I have decided to focus more on my developer side, which shaped up spontaneously. Thus, I have been focused on developing software for a few years and working on my projects.</p><br>

      <p>As an entrepreneur, I established and managed a boutique agency called Parazit Film & Digital Workz in 2009 in the marketing industry. We have worked with many industry leader companies. I am accepted to the entrepreneurship projects of institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Anadolu Foundation, and Endeavor. I have also been in organizations as a volunteer and in projects related to women entrepreneurship such as Bizbizze as a speaker for contributing to the community.</p><br><br>
